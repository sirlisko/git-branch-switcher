# git-branch-switcher

A comprehensive CLI tool for git branch management with interactive prompts. Switch, search, and delete branches effortlessly. Say goodbye to remembering branch names and typing long `git checkout` commands!

## Features

- üöÄ Interactive branch selection with multiple interfaces
- üîç Real-time branch search with filtering
- üóëÔ∏è Safe branch deletion with multi-select
- üìÖ Branches sorted by commit date (most recent first)
- üé® Colorized output for better readability
- ‚ö° Fast and lightweight
- üõ°Ô∏è Safety features (prevents remote branch deletion)
- üîß Two convenient commands: `git-branch-switcher` and `br`

## Installation

Install globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g git-branch-switcher
```

Or using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -g git-branch-switcher
```

## Usage

### Switch between local branches

```bash
git-branch-switcher
# or use the shorthand
br
```

This will show an interactive list of your local branches. Use arrow keys to navigate and press Enter to switch.

### Switch to remote branches

```bash
git-branch-switcher --remote
# or
br -r
```

This fetches and displays remote branches for checkout.

### Search for branches

```bash
git-branch-switcher --search
# or
br -s
```

Use the search interface to filter branches in real-time as you type.

### Delete local branches

```bash
git-branch-switcher --delete
# or
br -d

# Force delete (for unmerged branches)
git-branch-switcher --delete-force
# or
br -D
```

Select multiple local branches to delete. Remote branch deletion is blocked for safety.

### Combine options

```bash
# Search through remote branches
br --remote --search

# All available combinations work together
```

### Command options

```bash
git-branch-switcher [options]

  -r, --remote          Work with remote branches instead of local ones
  -s, --search          Use search interface for branch filtering
  -d, --delete          Delete selected branches (local only)
  -D, --delete-force    Force delete selected branches (local only)
